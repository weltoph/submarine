# submarine
This is an approach on building a low cost autonomous submarine.
It's started as a project at [ComSys, RWTH Aachen](https://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/home/).
You can find (its only) successful dive

# organisation
This project is organised in different repositorys, namely we distinguish between this repository which is considered the main-repo and the [submarine-arduino](https://github.com/lu-w/submarine-arduino) for the software of the arduino.
And finally there is [submarine-control](https://github.com/lu-w/submarine-control) for the android app that communicates with the built submarine.
In this repository the arduino and the control repo are included as submodules and furthermore we include here our final presentation of the project phase as well as a description on how we build the first prototype of our submarine.
Note that this description cannot be considered a thorough guide but more a hint from where to start your own project.
We are, by no means, experts on constructing submarines but just some guys with a strange idea.

# requirements
For our presentation we used the [metropolis theme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) which is also included as submodule here.
Please refer to the corresponding repository for information for the theme and how to install it.
The manual can be compiled as [tufte-latex](https://github.com/Tufte-LaTeX/tufte-latex) document.
Please refer to this repository for usage and installation.
